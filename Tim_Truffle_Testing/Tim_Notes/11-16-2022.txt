Okay, so I managed to configure a decent Solidity development environment. I believe there are a few
ways it can set up, but here is exactly what I have implemented if anyone would like to follow my strategy:

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT:
- Visual Studio + WSL 2 (ubuntu)

EXTENSIONS I KNOW YOU NEED TO HAVE:
- nodejs (v16.0.0)
- npm (7.10.0)
- git (2.25.1)
- Truffle (v5.6.5)
- Ganache (v7.5.0)
- Some sort of source control for QOL (I am using gitlens)

EXTENSIONS I AM USING BUT MAY NOT BE NECESSARY:
- Docker
- ETHover
- Jupyter
- PlantUML 
- Pylance / Python
- Solidity Contract Flattener
- Solidity Debugger
- Solidity Visual Debugger
- Truffle for VS Code

Fair warning - it is a pain in the ass to get all of this stuff set up, but such is life.
StackOverflow is your friend. 

So I guess the next steps for me are:
1. See if I can connect to any test / simulation networks.
2. Learn how to program smart contracts in Solidity.
3. Start digging into how we can implement our project and see what data is feasible to collect.
