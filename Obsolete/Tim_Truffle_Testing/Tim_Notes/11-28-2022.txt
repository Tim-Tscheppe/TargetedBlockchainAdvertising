Today I am working on begining to develop our pipeline to deploy / ping our
smart contracts and interface with python.

I am going to create some bash scripts that try to:
- Determine what O/S is being used (I will develop the linux support as I am using WSL). Later
on, someone can do it with Windows if they prefer to use Windows.
- Interface with the smart contract (Think "run truffle, send data to storage, stuff like that)
- Try to pull data from python executables and feed it to smart contract.
