1. Initialized repo
2. Pushed to remote from main okay
3. If this works, checkout branch/test/merge/push to main workflow will work properly. 
4. To get API to run properly, use pip to install "binance-connector"
For now, I can't get it to work because we need to generate keys and stuff but I think
it's a good proof of concept for now.
